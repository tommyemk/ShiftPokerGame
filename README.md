# ShiftPokerGame

ShiftPokerGame is a simple and entertaining poker game implemented in Kotlin.


## About the Project

I created this project to get hands-on experience with Kotlin and explore important programming concepts in practice.  
The goal was not only to learn Kotlin syntax, but also to apply object-oriented programming, design clean game logic, and implement basic testing strategies.  
This project gave me the opportunity to experiment with collections, classes, enums, and Kotlinâ€™s standard library, while also improving my understanding of project structure and maintainable code.
